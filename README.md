# MLG_Labo_5
Laboratoire 5 du cours de Machine Learning (MLG) portant sur l'apprentissage non-supervis√©.

## Introduction
Use Self-Organized Maps (SOM) and K-Means as a means for clustering and visualization
purposes using a collection of images.

## Practical work
### 1. Explore the use of Self-Organizing Maps and K-Means
To start, lets use the animals database to try the K-means and SOM algorithms with
different arguments and observe the results.
### 2. Clustering of wine data
Apply the K-means algorithm to the wine database. Use the 13 features of wine to find
clusters in the data. a) Set K=3 and run K-means, 10 times each time, and b) given that
you already know the type of wine for each observation, compute the average number
(based on your 10 runs) of the number of observations that are correctly grouped together
for each type of wine. Comment your results
### 3. Clustering of images application
We will provide you with a database of color images, a set of three feature extraction
methods and a SOM library. You may setup diverse experiments with the database, which
contains a lot of classes. You should apply the three feature extraction methods and
observe the results, and you have to modify the configuration and learning parameters of
the SOM algorithm

## Report
Present your results and comments for point 2 and regarding poins 3, simply follow the
instructions on the notebook SOM_part2.
